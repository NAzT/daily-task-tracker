h1. Browser Emergent Task Timer

This is the _Browser Emergent Task Timer_, a browser-based version of the printable "Emergent Task Timer":http://davidseah.com/blog/the-printable-ceo-iii-emergent-task-timing/ which is created by "David Seah":http://davidseah.com/. Do not confuse the BETT(Browser Emergent Task Timer) with the _Web Emergent Task Timer_ which is a Flash application, developed by David Seah. 

I started using the printable Emergent Task Timer recently and really liked the formatting. Having said that, I hate having to print one out for every day. With David's blessing I set out to create a browser-based version that would also be printer-friendly. It is important to note that the BETT(Browser Emergent Task Timer) is completely independant of needing an internet connection.
